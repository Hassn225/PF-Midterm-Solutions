Question #01: Find the errors in the following codes. If no error, then write output.

(a)
Original snippet:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int I, J;
    for (I = 1; I > 7; I++)
        cout << I;
    cout << "End of Program";
    return 7;
}

Analysis / Errors:
1. Logic error in loop condition: `I > 7` is incorrect if the intention is to count from 1 up to 6. Because I starts at 1, `I > 7` is false immediately and the loop never executes.
2. `return 7;` is not a compile error but non-standard for indicating successful termination. Conventionally `return 0;` is used.
3. No syntax errors otherwise.

Output if code is run as-is:
Because loop body never runs, output is:
End of Program

Corrected (intent: print 1..6 then End of Program):
for (I = 1; I < 7; I++)
    cout << I << " ";
cout << "End of Program";
(return 0;)

(b)
Original snippet:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;
    if (num1 < num2)
        cout << "num1 is smallest";
        num1 = num2;
    else
        cout << "num2 is smallest";
    return 0;
}

Analysis / Errors:
1. Missing braces `{ ... }` for the `if` block. Because of that, the `if` controls only the first statement `cout << ...;`.
2. The line `num1 = num2;` appears between the `if` and the `else`. This causes a syntax error at compile time: the `else` no longer matches the `if` (C++ will give "else without a previous if" or similar).
3. Likely intended behavior is to perform both the `cout` and assignment inside the if block or to have only the cout inside if and not the assignment — intent is unclear.

Fix (one possible correct version):
if (num1 < num2) {
    cout << "num1 is smallest";
    num1 = num2;   // if this assignment is intended
} else {
    cout << "num2 is smallest";
}

If corrected this way, output (with initial values 5 and 10):
num1 is smallest

(c)
Original snippet:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a = 0, b = 1;
    a = b++;         // post-increment
    cout << a << b;
    b = ++a;         // pre-increment
    cout << a << b;
    return 0;
}

Analysis / Errors:
1. No syntax errors.
2. This uses pre- and post-increment operators; compute step-by-step:

Step 1: a=0, b=1
a = b++;   // a gets old b (1), then b becomes 2
Now: a = 1, b = 2
cout << a << b;  // prints "12"

Step 2:
b = ++a;   // a is pre-incremented to 2, then assigned to b
Now: a = 2, b = 2
cout << a << b;  // prints "22"

Final output (concatenated with no spaces): 
1222

(d)
Original snippet:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "enter values";
    int a, b, res;
    cin >> a; cin >> b;
    a = 20; b = 10;
    a + b = res;
    cout << "res = " << res;
    return 0;
}

Analysis / Errors:
1. `a + b = res;` is invalid. Assignment's left side must be an l-value variable. The correct assignment to store the sum is `res = a + b;`.
2. The code reads `a` and `b` from input but then immediately overwrites them with `a = 20; b = 10;`. That makes the `cin` useless. Either remove the overwriting assignments or remove the `cin` depending on the intended behavior.
3. No other syntax errors (variables declared before use, etc).

Corrected version (if intent is to read values and print their sum):
int a, b, res;
cout << "enter values";
cin >> a >> b;
res = a + b;
cout << "res = " << res;

Example (input 5 7) -> output:
res = 12

---

Notes:
- For (b) the compiler will complain because `else` has no matching `if` due to the intervening statement; this is an important syntax error to point out.
- For (a) returning a non-zero value is not an error but not typical; most graders expect `return 0;` for successful termination.
