Question #02: Define any two from the following. Provide examples where useful.

1) Header files
Definition:
Header files are files included at the top of a source file that provide declarations (functions, classes, macros, constants) so the compiler knows how to use library features.

Example:
#include <iostream>
This header declares std::cout and std::cin used for input/output in C++.

Another example:
#include <cmath>
Provides declarations for math functions like sqrt(), sin(), cos().

2) Source code
Definition:
Source code is the human-readable program text written by a programmer (usually in files with extensions like .cpp, .c, .py). It is the code that gets compiled or interpreted to run a program.

Example:
A file `Q3.cpp` containing:
#include <iostream>
int main() { std::cout << "Hello"; return 0; }

3) Comments
Definition:
Comments are non-executable notes in source code used to explain or document the code for humans. The compiler ignores them.

Types / Examples in C++:
- Single-line comment:
// This is a single-line comment

- Multi-line comment:
/* This is a
   multi-line comment */

Good practice:
Use comments to explain *why* something is done (not *what* every line does when it's obvious). Keep comments concise and meaningful.
